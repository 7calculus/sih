# Changes made this pass

## 1. Label swap (trivial fix)
`dashboard/src/App.jsx` — header `<h1>`/`<h2>` text were swapped. Now:
- `<h1>` = "SURAKSHA LANDER" (big title)
- `<h2>` = "LUNAR TELEMETRY" (subtitle)

## 2. Live 2D map + trajectory trail (items #1 and #3)
`dashboard/src/App.jsx`:
- New `RoverMap` component — plain SVG, no Deck.gl, no new deps.
  - Draws the accumulated position trail as a polyline.
  - Draws a dashed circle around the rover sized to the current
    `uncertainty` value (meters), color-coded by mode (cyan = Driving,
    yellow = Caution, red = Relocalizing).
  - Draws the rover as a glowing marker.
  - Auto-fits its view to whatever the rover has actually covered so far
    (recomputed via `useMemo` off the trail + uncertainty), so it works
    whether the run covers 50m or 5km — nothing hardcoded to the
    `goal_pos = (500, 480)` in `simulation/main.py`.
- Trail is accumulated **client-side**: every WS telemetry packet that
  moves >5cm from the last recorded point gets pushed into a capped
  (400-point) array in React state. This is a no-op change to any
  backend/M2 code — `localization/state.py` and `simulation/main.py`
  are untouched.
- Wired into a new grid row between the existing 3-panel telemetry strip
  and the reasoning terminal panel: map takes 2/3 width, audit trail
  panel takes 1/3 width.

## 3. Audit trail endpoint + panel (item #2)
`backend/api.py`:
- Added a guarded import of `explain.audit_logger.read_log` (same
  fallback pattern as the other optional imports already in the file).
- Added `GET /audit-log?limit=20` — returns
  `{"decisions": [...]}`, most-recent-first, reading directly from
  `explain/decision_log.json` via the existing `read_log()` function
  (that function already existed in `audit_logger.py` — nothing there
  was changed).

`dashboard/src/App.jsx`:
- New `AuditLogPanel` component, polls `/audit-log` every 5s (separate
  from the 1Hz WS stream, since decisions only land on re-localization
  events) and lists each decision's timestamp + explanation text.
- `API_BASE` is derived from `VITE_WS_URL` (`ws://host:8000/ws` →
  `http://host:8000`) so no new env var/build arg is needed in
  `docker-compose.yml` or `dashboard/Dockerfile`.

## Nothing else touched
M2 localizer, M4 planner, M6 explain module, crater_loader, DEM loader,
docker-compose, Dockerfiles — all untouched. `npm run build` in
`dashboard/` passes cleanly with these changes (verified).

# Running without Docker (quick local dev loop)

Needs Python 3.11 + GDAL system libs (rasterio dependency) and Node 20.

## 1. System deps (GDAL) — skip if already installed
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gdal-bin libgdal-dev libgl1 libglib2.0-0
```

## 2. Python env
```bash
cd sih
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3. Data files
Make sure these exist relative to the repo root (same paths the code
already expects):
- `data/Lunar_Map.tiff` — the DEM GeoTIFF used by `load_dem()`
- `crater_db/crater_db.sqlite` — already in the zip

If you don't have `data/Lunar_Map.tiff` yet, that's a separate M1 data
question — not something this pass touched.

## 4. Run backend + simulator (2 terminals, no shared-volume needed
   locally since both processes share the same filesystem)
```bash
# terminal 1 — API + WebSocket server
cd sih
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn backend.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

# terminal 2 — the orchestrator that actually drives the rover sim
cd sih
source .venv/bin/activate
python simulation/main.py
```
Note: locally you do **not** need to set `TELEMETRY_FILE` — it
defaults to `localization/telemetry.json`, and since both processes run
on the same machine (no containers), they share that file automatically.

## 5. Run the dashboard
```bash
cd sih/dashboard
npm install
npm run dev
```
Vite will print a local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`). The
dashboard defaults to `ws://localhost:8000/ws` if `VITE_WS_URL` isn't
set, which matches the backend from step 4 — no `.env` needed for pure
local dev.

## 6. Sanity check
- Open the dashboard URL — you should see telemetry updating every ~1s,
  the live map building a trail, and (once the rover crosses the
  uncertainty threshold and re-localizes at least once) an entry
  appearing in the Audit Trail panel.
- `curl http://localhost:8000/audit-log` should return JSON once at
  least one re-localization + explanation has been logged.

---

## 7. 3D terrain and audit-log startup fix

The dashboard's 3D terrain and audit panel were reporting `Failed to fetch`
because port 8000 was serving the outer `sih/backend/api.py` copy. That copy
only defines `/` and `/ws`, so `/terrain-heightmap` and `/audit-log` returned
404 without the CORS headers from the inner application.

The inner `backend/api.py` now:

- Resolves `data/Lunar_Map.tiff` and `crater_db/crater_db.sqlite` from the
  inner `sih` project directory, independent of the terminal's current
  directory.
- Allows both `localhost:5173` and `127.0.0.1:5173` as dashboard origins.
- Uses the same absolute DEM path for the WebSocket evaluation loop.
- Resamples the GeoTIFF while reading it, so the 3D endpoint does not load
  all 924 million source cells into memory before creating a small heightmap.
- Imports the existing `load_craters` function instead of the nonexistent
  `load_craters_from_db`, restoring live crater evaluation in the WebSocket.
- Caches crater evaluation metrics from a 600x600 resampled DEM instead of
  reloading and processing the full 30,400x30,400 raster every WebSocket tick.
  This keeps `/terrain-heightmap` responsive while telemetry is connected.
- Adjusts crater Hough detection to the DEM's 2-20 pixel crater radius range.
- Converts local detector pixels into DEM world-meter coordinates before
  passing them to the localizer.
- Adds an explicit simulation-only catalog fallback when a local DEM patch has
  fewer than three visible craters, allowing uncertainty recovery instead of
  repeatedly failing correction.

## 8. DEM navigation, rover POV, and real route audit

The earlier dashboard showed a generic rover trail and a full-tile 3D mesh,
which made the rover appear stationary and did not expose the planner's actual
decision. This pass changes the behavior to:

- Derive a slope map from `data/Lunar_Map.tiff` and give that to A* instead of
  treating elevation values as slope angles.
- Convert the planner's downsampled grid coordinates back into the DEM's local
  meter frame.
- Make the simulator follow the selected terrain-aware route waypoint by
  waypoint instead of driving a hard-coded straight line.
- Persist `path_a`, `path_b`, `active_path`, and `route_index` in telemetry.
- Draw Path A, Path B, the selected route, and the rover's travelled trail in
  the 2D map with separate colors and line styles.
- Make the Three.js view follow the rover at local scale, looking forward over
  the same TIFF-derived mesh. The full-tile mesh is still the source, but the
  camera is now a rover POV rather than a distant overview.
- Compute audit slip risk, covariance exposure, and energy proxy from the
  actual derived slope map and route distance. Audit entries are created when
  the simulator replans and are displayed by the existing `/audit-log` poll.
- Replace the unrelated orbital/debris placeholder text with truthful rover
  terrain-navigation labels. CORS configuration was left unchanged.
- Prevent WebSocket reconnect timers from surviving React cleanup, which was
  creating duplicate browser connections.
- Treat closed/reset WebSocket sends as normal disconnects in the backend,
  preventing repeated `socket.send() raised exception` noise.
- Normalize crater database `diameter` values to detector `radius` values in
  backend evaluation, restoring live precision/recall calculation.

## 9. Blue scan, red hazard, green route behavior

The repeated audit entries were caused by comparing two routes generated with
the same cost model. The simulation now:

- Plans on a denser local window of the real `Lunar_Map.tiff`, so paths have
  visible waypoints instead of only three coarse cells.
- Loads an 800x800 local TIFF window for the simulator, avoiding the long
  30,400x30,400 startup read while preserving the real DEM values used by the
  local mission.
- Builds Path A with a strong slope penalty and a 15-degree safe-slope limit.
- Builds Path B as the shortest practical route with a low slope penalty and a
  wider 35-degree limit.
- Scans the terrain ahead of the rover from the derived DEM slope map.
- Shows the scan state in blue, measured terrain hazards in red, and a clear
  route state in green.
- Logs a route decision only when a new hazard cell is detected, instead of
  writing identical decisions every loop.
- Keeps the hazard marker visible after detection but returns the rover state
  to green route-following on subsequent scans of the same cell.

## 10. Coordinate-frame and route-visibility correction

The 3D screenshot showed the rover floating because the mesh was emitted in
absolute TIFF coordinates (`-304000..304000`) while telemetry and routes use a
local rover frame near `(0, 0)`. The terrain endpoint now centers its `x_coords`
and `y_coords` around zero, and the frontend requests `frame=local-v2` so an
old cached mesh cannot be reused.

The 2D map now refits whenever route data arrives and draws the cyan active
route underneath the purple Path A and orange Path B lines, so selected-route
segments no longer hide the candidate route colors.

## 11. Local route horizon and nearby hazard cleanup

The route was previously serialized from the rover to the entire goal, which
made it look pre-scripted. The simulator now publishes only the next 10
waypoints and replans that horizon as the rover advances. The hazard payload
contains only the currently scanned nearby hazard and is cleared when the
forward scan is clear. Multiple simulator processes must not run at the same
time because they share `localization/telemetry.json`; stop old copies before
starting a new one.

After updating, hard-refresh the browser once (`Ctrl+F5`) to clear the prior
heightmap from memory. Then select `2D` or `3D` again.
- Persists hazard coordinates, scan state, decision id, and selected path in
  telemetry so the 2D and 3D views show the same event.
- Adds hazard crosses/markers and route colors to 2D and 3D. The 3D rover now
  has a chassis, mast, and four wheels, and the DEM mesh uses elevation-based
  vertex shading so the real TIFF relief is visible.

Restart all processes after pulling these changes:

```powershell
# Backend
cd C:\Users\prava\OneDrive\Desktop\PROJECTS\SURAKSHALANDER\sih\sih
python -m uvicorn backend.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Simulation, in a second terminal
cd C:\Users\prava\OneDrive\Desktop\PROJECTS\SURAKSHALANDER\sih\sih
python simulation/main.py

# Dashboard, in a third terminal
cd C:\Users\prava\OneDrive\Desktop\PROJECTS\SURAKSHALANDER\sih\sih\dashboard
npm run dev
```

The 2D map should show purple/orange candidate routes, cyan active route,
red hazard markers, and a green rover when clear. The 3D tab uses the same
coordinates and state over the actual TIFF-derived mesh.

### Run order

Use three terminals from the inner project directory:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\prava\OneDrive\Desktop\PROJECTS\SURAKSHALANDER\sih\sih
..\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m uvicorn backend.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

```powershell
cd C:\Users\prava\OneDrive\Desktop\PROJECTS\SURAKSHALANDER\sih\sih
..\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python simulation/main.py
```

```powershell
cd C:\Users\prava\OneDrive\Desktop\PROJECTS\SURAKSHALANDER\sih\sih\dashboard
npm run dev
```

Open the Vite URL, choose `2D` to inspect candidate and selected paths, or
choose `3D` for the rover-following TIFF view. The audit panel updates after a
route plan/re-localization event; verify it directly with:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:8000/audit-log
```

Run the backend from the inner project directory so the dashboard reaches the
application that owns both routes:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\prava\OneDrive\Desktop\PROJECTS\SURAKSHALANDER\sih\sih
..\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m uvicorn backend.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Then run the dashboard from `sih/sih/dashboard` and verify the backend:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:8000/
Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:8000/audit-log
Invoke-RestMethod "http://localhost:8000/terrain-heightmap?grid_size=16"
```

# On the 3D / real DEM request

Given the "severe time pressure" framing and the explicit priority
order you gave (#4 → #1+#3 → #2), I held off on building a 3D terrain
view against the LOLA DEM tile — that's a materially bigger lift
(loading/reprojecting a real GeoTIFF client-side or via a tile
service, a Three.js/Deck.gl terrain mesh, camera controls) than the
SVG 2D map, and the PRD itself already downgraded this from
Deck.gl to "SVG/Canvas 2D is acceptable given time constraints."
The 2D map above satisfies the stated requirement.

If you still want a 3D pass after submission (or have spare time
before the deadline), the realistic path would be: pre-render the
`LDEM_80S_20MPP_ADJ.TIF` you linked into a heightmap-friendly format
(e.g. a downsampled PNG or a `.bin` of floats) offline via `terrain/dem_loader.py`
+ `rasterio`, ship that static asset to the frontend, and render it
with a Three.js `PlaneGeometry` + vertex displacement, with the rover
trail extruded slightly above the mesh. Happy to build that next if
there's time after the current three fixes are confirmed working.
